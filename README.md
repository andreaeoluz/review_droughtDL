# Deep Learning Approaches for Drought Forecasting, Monitoring and Impact Assessment: A Comprehensive Systematic Review

This repository contains the data and supplementary materials for the systematic review.

# 🌍 Overview

Droughts are complex and multifaceted hazards with severe socio-environmental consequences. This study systematically reviews the application of deep learning (DL) models in drought prediction and monitoring, with a particular focus on the integration of remote sensing (RS) data.
